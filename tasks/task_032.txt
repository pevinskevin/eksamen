# Task ID: 32
# Title: BE: Error Handling Architecture Refactor
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Remove all error handling from services and repositories, centralizing it in routers
# Details:
Refactor the backend architecture to move all try-catch blocks and error handling logic from service and repository layers to their respective routers. Services and repositories should throw errors and let routers handle HTTP responses and status codes.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit Current Error Handling in Services and Repositories [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review all existing service and repository files to identify current error handling patterns and try-catch blocks that need to be moved to routers
### Details:


## 2. Refactor User Services to Remove Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Remove try-catch blocks from user services and let them throw errors instead
### Details:


## 3. Refactor Other Services (Crypto, Account, Order) to Remove Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Remove try-catch blocks from cryptocurrency, account, and order services
### Details:


## 4. Update All Routers with Centralized Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 32.2, 32.3
### Description: Add proper try-catch blocks and error handling to all router files to handle errors thrown by services
### Details:


## 5. Test and Verify Error Handling Refactor [done]
### Dependencies: 32.4
### Description: Test all endpoints to ensure error handling works correctly and consistently across all routers
### Details:

Successfully identified and fixed authentication middleware OpenAPI compliance issue. Authentication error handling now works correctly:

Fixed authentication middleware to use sendUnauthorized helper.
Verified accounts endpoint returns proper 401 with error object.
Verified orders endpoint returns proper 401 with error object.
Removed hardcoded authentication bypass (completed Task 35).

The error handling refactor is working correctly. All routers have comprehensive try-catch blocks and proper error response formatting.

Completed comprehensive error handling verification across all routers:

Authentication Errors: 401 responses with proper error format
Validation Errors: 400/422 responses for OpenAPI and custom validation
Business Logic Errors: 409 for conflicts, 422 for custom business rules
Resource Not Found: 404 responses with proper error messages
Input Validation: 400 responses for malformed parameters
Authenticated Endpoints: Proper success responses with valid sessions
Authenticated Error Handling: 404 errors work correctly in authenticated context

All routers consistently use proper error response format:
{
  "error": "ErrorType",
  "message": "Descriptive error message"
}

Status codes are appropriate:
- 400: Bad Request (OpenAPI validation)
- 401: Unauthorized (authentication required)
- 404: Not Found (resource doesn't exist)
- 409: Conflict (duplicate resources)
- 422: Unprocessable Entity (business rule violations)

Error handling refactor is complete and working perfectly.
