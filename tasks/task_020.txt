# Task ID: 20
# Title: FE: Real-time Order Book Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 15, 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a Svelte component to visualize the live order book (bids and asks). This component should subscribe to WebSocket updates for the selected cryptocurrency pair and efficiently re-render the display when new data arrives.
# Details:
Create `OrderBook.svelte` component. Props: `selectedPair`. On component mount or when `selectedPair` changes: send a WebSocket message to subscribe to that pair's order book updates (if backend requires explicit subscription). Listen for `ORDER_BOOK_UPDATE` messages. When data arrives, update local Svelte stores or component state for bids and asks. Render two lists (bids in green, asks in red), sorted by price, showing price, quantity, and cumulative quantity. Use Svelte's reactivity for efficient DOM updates (`{#each ... key=...}`).

# Test Strategy:
Order book display updates in near real-time when orders are placed or matched on the backend. Bids and asks are displayed correctly, sorted, and styled. Performance should be acceptable.
