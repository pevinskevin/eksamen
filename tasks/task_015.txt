# Task ID: 15
# Title: FE: WebSocket Client Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement WebSocket client logic in the Svelte frontend to connect to the backend WebSocket server. Handle opening of the connection and receiving basic messages.
# Details:
In a Svelte store or a root component (`App.svelte` or `+layout.svelte`), establish a WebSocket connection: `const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000'); socket.onopen = () => console.log('Connected to WebSocket'); socket.onmessage = event => console.log('Message from server:', event.data); socket.onclose = () => console.log('Disconnected from WebSocket');`. Ensure this runs client-side.

# Test Strategy:
Svelte frontend successfully connects to the backend WebSocket server. Console logs confirm connection and any test messages sent from server are received.
