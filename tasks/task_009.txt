# Task ID: 9
# Title: BE: Account & CryptoHolding Models & Balance API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement backend models for `Accounts` (fiat) and `CryptoHoldings` (crypto). Create API endpoints for authenticated users to fetch their balances. Implement logic to seed initial simulated fiat (e.g., SIM_USD) and/or crypto balances for new users upon registration or first login.
# Details:
Create `/account/balances` GET endpoint, protected by auth middleware. This endpoint should query `Accounts` and `CryptoHoldings` tables for the logged-in user (`req.user.id`). Return a consolidated list of balances. Implement logic (e.g., during user registration or a separate seeding function) to give new users a starting amount of 'SIM_USD' in their `Accounts` table and potentially some base simulated crypto in `CryptoHoldings`.

# Test Strategy:
Authenticated users can fetch their balances via the API. New users should have default seeded balances. Balances should reflect database state.
