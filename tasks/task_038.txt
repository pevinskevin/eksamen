# Task ID: 38
# Title: Simple MCP AI Functionality Verification
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 37
# Priority: low
# Description: Perform a targeted, simple test to confirm a core capability of the MCP AI (Task Master AI) is functioning as expected, post-integration with the Google API key and initial comprehensive testing.
# Details:
1. Prerequisite: MCP AI (Task Master AI) has been integrated with the Google API key and has undergone comprehensive testing (as per Task 37).
2. Identify a single, straightforward AI function to test. Example: Given a short user story, the AI should generate 3 relevant tags.
3. Input: A specific, concise user story (e.g., "As a user, I want to reset my password so I can regain access to my account.").
4. Expected Output: A list of 3 relevant tags (e.g., ["password reset", "account recovery", "security"]). The expected tags should be predefined for the chosen test case.
5. Execution:
    a. Access the MCP AI interface or API endpoint.
    b. Provide the defined input user story.
    c. Capture the AI's generated tags.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify the MCP AI endpoint is accessible and responsive.
2. Submit the predefined user story to the AI.
3. Collect the generated tags from the AI's response.
4. Compare the generated tags against the predefined expected tags. The test passes if the generated output sufficiently matches the expected output (e.g., at least 2 out of 3 tags match or are clear semantic equivalents, or as defined by the specific test case criteria).
5. Document the input, expected output, actual output, and pass/fail result. Note any discrepancies or unexpected behavior for further review.
