# Task ID: 11
# Title: BE: Order & Trade Models & DB Schema
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Define and implement database schema for `Orders` and `Trades` within the existing `createDb.js` script. `Orders` will store user's buy/sell orders. `Trades` will record executed transactions between users.
# Details:
Extend DB schema by defining `Orders` and `Trades` tables within `createDb.js`. `Orders` (order_id PK, user_id FK, cryptocurrency_id FK, type ('buy'/'sell'), order_type ('limit'/'market'), quantity_total DECIMAL, quantity_remaining DECIMAL, price DECIMAL, status ('open', 'partially_filled', 'fully_filled', 'cancelled'), created_at, updated_at). `Trades` (trade_id PK, buy_order_id FK, sell_order_id FK, cryptocurrency_id FK, quantity DECIMAL, price DECIMAL, buyer_user_id FK, seller_user_id FK, trade_timestamp). The `createDb.js` script will handle schema creation, dropping, and resetting; formal versioned migration tool integration is not planned for this task.

# Test Strategy:
Verify `Orders` and `Trades` tables are created correctly in the database with all specified fields and constraints by running the `createDb.js` script. Ensure the script can successfully drop and recreate these tables.
