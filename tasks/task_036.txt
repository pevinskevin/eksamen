# Task ID: 36
# Title: BE: Restore OpenAPI Cookie Authentication Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 31, 35
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure the OpenAPI specification properly validates cookie authentication and that the cookieAuth security scheme is correctly configured for all protected endpoints.
# Details:
1. Verify the cookieAuth security scheme is properly defined in openapi.yml components/securitySchemes
2. Ensure all protected endpoints have the 'security: - cookieAuth: []' declaration
3. Confirm the OpenAPI validation middleware correctly validates cookies before requests reach application middleware
4. Test that OpenAPI validation rejects requests without proper cookies
5. Ensure API documentation accurately reflects authentication requirements

This provides the first line of defense and ensures API documentation accuracy.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test that OpenAPI validation rejects requests without connect.sid cookie
2. Test that OpenAPI validation rejects requests with invalid session IDs
3. Verify protected endpoints in API docs show authentication requirement
4. Test that valid authenticated requests pass OpenAPI validation
5. Confirm error responses match OpenAPI specification
