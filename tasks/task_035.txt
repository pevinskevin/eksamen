# Task ID: 35
# Title: BE: Fix Authentication Middleware Security Bypass
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 32, 33
# Priority: high
# Description: Remove hardcoded authentication bypass from backend/shared/middleware/authorisation.js. The middleware currently hardcodes userId=1 and role='admin' for all requests instead of validating sessions. This creates a critical security vulnerability.
# Details:
1. Remove the hardcoded authentication bypass (lines 9-14 in authorisation.js)
2. Uncomment and restore the proper session validation logic (lines 2-8)
3. Ensure proper 401 responses for unauthenticated requests
4. Verify req.user is correctly populated from session data
5. Test all protected endpoints to ensure authentication works correctly

This is critical for application security before any production deployment.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test that protected routes return 401 when no session cookie is sent
2. Test that protected routes return 401 when session exists but userId is missing
3. Test that protected routes allow access when valid session exists
4. Verify req.user is correctly populated with session data
5. Test logout functionality properly destroys sessions
